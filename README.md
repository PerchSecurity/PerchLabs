<h1> Perch Labs Threat Feeds</h1>
<p>This repo contains lists of indicators discovered by the Perch Labs team using our internal sandbox or found while thrunting through customer data.  We currently have 2 lists, ips and domains.  For now these are simple lists but in the future we will be enriching the data with additional context.</p>
<h2>Mozi Tracker</h2>
<p>We see thousands of Mozi bots attempting to spread on a monthly basis.  The Mozi tracker is a CSV of all the Mozi URLs we've seen actively in use in the past 14 days.</p>
